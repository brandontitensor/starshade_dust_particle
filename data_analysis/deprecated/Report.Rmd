## Executive Summary

This report summarizes Brandon Titensor's area-based analysis of particulate contamination on starshade optical edges, complementing the research conducted by McKeithen et al. The analysis quantifies the relationship between surface contamination and edge contamination, validating models that predict edge particle distribution from surface measurements. These findings are critical for establishing contamination requirements for future starshade deployments in space telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

## Key Definitions and Statistical Methods

Before discussing the results, it's important to understand the following key terms and statistical methods used in this analysis:

**Key Terms:**
- **PCL (Product Cleanliness Level)**: A measure from IEST-STD-CC1246E that describes contamination levels on surfaces
- **PAC (Percent Area Coverage)**: The percentage of surface area covered by particulate contamination
- **Surface Contamination**: Particles present on flat surfaces of materials
- **Edge Contamination**: Particles that hang over or are present at the edge of materials
- **SLSM (Straight Line Surface Model)**: A model predicting edge particle distribution from surface measurements

**Statistical Methods Used:**

1. **Correlation Analysis (Pearson's r)**: Measures the linear relationship between two distributions. Values closer to 1 indicate stronger positive correlation.
   - *Why used*: To determine how closely different trials or models align with each other

2. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test**: Compares two probability distributions to determine if they differ significantly.
   - *Why used*: To statistically verify if observed distributions match predicted ones

3. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and observed values.
   - *Why used*: To quantify the accuracy of prediction models

4. **Regression Analysis**: Examines the relationship between particle size and frequency, yielding slope and intercept values.
   - *Why used*: To characterize particle distributions mathematically

5. **Area Under Curve (AUC)**: Integrates the total area under a distribution curve.
   - *Why used*: To compare the overall magnitude of contamination between trials

## Surface Area Distribution Analysis

The analysis of surface particle distributions across multiple trials (9-12) revealed consistent patterns with some notable variations:

- **Distribution Characteristics**: All trials showed log-normal distributions of particle sizes, consistent with IEST-STD-CC1246E standards
- **Slope Values**: Surface distributions had slopes ranging from -1.56 to -1.95, steeper than the standard -0.926 slope in IEST standards
- **Correlation Between Trials**: Very high correlation between trials (r > 0.96), indicating excellent reproducibility in contamination experiments
- **Trial Differences**: Trial 11 showed the highest area under curve (23.8) compared to other trials (21.2-22.0), suggesting somewhat higher contamination levels

The close agreement between surface measurements across trials demonstrates the reliability of the contamination analysis methodology. The steeper slopes compared to the IEST standard indicate a different size distribution in the test dust used for these experiments than what is typically found in cleanroom environments.

## Edge Area Distribution Analysis

The edge particle distribution analysis revealed several important findings:

- **Edge vs. Surface Distributions**: Edge distributions show different characteristics than surface distributions, with notable differences in small vs. large particles
- **Small vs. Large Particles**: Smaller particles (<100 μm²) appear more frequently on edges than predicted by surface measurements, while larger particles appear less frequently
- **"Adhesion Factor"**: The analysis confirms the existence of an adhesion factor that varies inversely with particle diameter, explaining why large particles are less likely to remain on edges
- **Model Validation**: The SLSM model with adhesion correction closely matched observed edge distributions (r > 0.99), validating its use for predicting edge contamination

These findings support McKeithen et al.'s hypothesis that edge contamination cannot be directly extrapolated from surface measurements without accounting for particle size-dependent adhesion factors.

## Calibration Analysis

The calibration analysis using glass masks with chrome edges provided crucial validation of the edge contamination model:

- **Calibration vs. Etched Samples**: The calibration mask showed significantly different edge particle retention characteristics compared to etched metal samples
- **Model Confirmation**: The calibration data confirmed that the straight-line surface model (SLSM) accurately predicts particle distribution on edges when no particles can fall off (as in the glass/chrome interface)
- **Statistical Significance**: K-S tests showed significant differences between calibration and observed distributions (p < 0.001), confirming that the etched samples behave differently than the calibration samples

The calibration analysis validated the fundamental assumption that surface particle distribution can predict edge contamination in ideal circumstances, while also quantifying the deviations that occur with actual etched metal edges.

## Trial Analysis Comparisons

When comparing results across all trials (9-12), several consistent patterns emerged:

- **Inter-trial Consistency**: High correlations (r > 0.97) between trials for both surface and edge measurements
- **Model Performance**: The corrected model consistently predicted edge contamination with high accuracy across all trials (RMSE values of 0.04-0.36)
- **Edge-to-Surface Ratio**: Across all trials, edge contamination showed a consistent relationship to surface contamination when adjusted for the adhesion factor
- **PCL Correlation**: All trials showed consistent relationships between PCL values and resulting edge contamination, supporting the paper's conclusions about cleanliness requirements

This consistency across trials supports the robustness of the findings and their applicability to real-world starshade manufacturing and handling scenarios.

## Multiple Line Analysis

The analysis of multiple edge lines within the same samples showed:

- **Line-to-Line Variation**: Low variation between different lines on the same sample (correlation r > 0.99)
- **Statistical Uniformity**: K-S tests showed no significant differences between lines (p > 0.9 in most comparisons)
- **Consistent Slopes**: The slope parameters of particle distributions were remarkably consistent across all lines (-0.56 to -0.58)

This high degree of uniformity indicates that edge contamination is consistent along the entire perimeter of samples, which is crucial for extrapolating these findings to the full-scale starshade designs.

## Implications for Starshade Design

Based on the findings, several important implications for starshade design and handling emerge:

1. **Cleanliness Requirements**: The analysis supports the paper's conclusion that PCL levels of 410-460 are required to limit on-sky brightness to magnitude 33
2. **Surface to Edge Prediction**: Surface contamination measurements can reliably predict edge contamination when using the corrected model with the adhesion factor
3. **Handling Protocols**: The inverse relationship between particle size and adhesion suggests that controlling larger particles (>100 μm²) may be less critical than controlling smaller particles
4. **Model Application**: The validated SLSM with adhesion correction can be used to monitor starshade edge contamination throughout manufacturing and deployment phases

These findings provide quantitative support for establishing contamination control requirements for future starshade missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory concepts.

## Conclusions

The area-based analysis has successfully:

1. Validated the relationship between surface and edge contamination
2. Confirmed the existence of a particle size-dependent adhesion factor
3. Demonstrated the accuracy of the corrected predictive model
4. Established the reliability of these findings across multiple trials and sample locations

These results strengthen the conclusions of McKeithen et al. regarding contamination control requirements for starshade optical edges. The statistical validation of the surface-to-edge contamination model provides a reliable method for monitoring starshade edge cleanliness throughout the manufacturing, assembly, testing, and deployment phases of future missions.
